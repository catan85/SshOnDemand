I've tried to adopt a clean architecture (simplified)
So, the structure is the following

Presentation 
	>	Application 
		> Infrastructure 
			> Core
ApiServer		
	>	ApiServer.Application
		>	ApiServer.Infrastructure
			>	ApiServer.Core

The inner layers cannot know the external layers.

Application contains the entities used by the presentation (request, response, common entities)
Infrastructure contains the entities used by the database (entity framework in this case)
Core contains the domain level entities, the core functionalities that shouldn't know nothing about the external layers
